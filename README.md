# CS61A

The course is an introduction to computer science with emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view. The main concentrations are on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.

CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. Python is a popular language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to the task of exploring the topics taught in this course. It is an open-source language developed by a large volunteer community that prides itself on the diversity of its contributors. We will also use two other languages in the latter half of the course: the Scheme programming language and the Structured Query Language (SQL).

### Projects:

#### Hog Project:
The purpose of the project is to learn to develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog. Students are required to use control statements and higher-order functions to complete this project.
