# CS61A

The course is an introduction to computer science with emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view. The main concentrations are on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.

CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. Python is a popular language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to the task of exploring the topics taught in this course. It is an open-source language developed by a large volunteer community that prides itself on the diversity of its contributors. We will also use two other languages in the latter half of the course: the Scheme programming language and the Structured Query Language (SQL).

### Projects:

#### - Hog Project:
The purpose of the project is to learn to develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog. Students are required to use control statements and higher-order functions to complete this project.

Project's instruction: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su20/proj/hog/

#### - Cat Project:
The purpose of the project is to write a program that measures typing speed. Additionally, it is required to implement typing autocorrect, which is a feature that attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it.

#### - Ants Project:
The purpose of the project is to create a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.

This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms, focusing on the material from Object-Oriented Programming. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.

#### - Scheme Project:
The purpose of the project is to develop an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. As you proceed, think about the issues that arise in the design of a programming language; many quirks of languages are byproducts of implementation decisions in interpreters and compilers. The subset of the language used in this project is described in the functional programming section of Composing Programs. Since we only include a subset of the language, your interpreter will not exactly match the behavior of other interpreters.

You will also implement some small programs in Scheme. Scheme is a simple but powerful functional language. You should find that much of what you have learned about Python transfers cleanly to Scheme as well as to other programming languages.

Later, there will also be an open-ended graphics contest (released separately) that challenges you to produce recursive images in only a few lines of Scheme. As an example, the picture above abstractly depicts all the ways of making change for $0.50 using U.S. currency. All flowers appear at the end of a branch with length 50. Small angles in a branch indicate an additional coin, while large angles indicate a new currency denomination. In the contest, you too will have the chance to unleash your inner recursive artist.
